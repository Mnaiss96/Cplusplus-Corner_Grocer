# Summarize the project and what problem was it solving 
The project involves creating an ItemTracker class that manages grocery item data. 
The class provides functionality to read data from a file, backup data, display a menu for user interaction, search for items, print item frequencies, and print a histogram based on item frequencies.

# What did you do particularly well? 
One particularly well-done aspect of my code is the organization and encapsulation of functionality within the "ItemTracker" class. 
Each member function has a specific purpose, contributing to the overall functionality of the class.

# Where could you enhance your code? How could these improvements make your code more efficent, secure, etc? 
To enhance the code, error handling mechanisms could be improved. 
For example, adding more robust error handling for file operations could make the code more reliable. 
Additionally, input validation in the menu system could be enhanced to handle unexpected user inputs more gracefully.

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The most challenging part of writing the code was probably designing the menu system and implementing user input handling. 
To overcome this, I relied on knowledge of control flow structures in C++, as well as understanding how to interact with standard input and output streams.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Skills gained from this project, such as working with file I/O, data structures like maps, and implementing user interfaces, will be highly transferable to other projects and coursework involving similar tasks.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
To make the program maintainable, readable, and adaptable, I followed good coding practices such as using meaningful variable names, modularizing code into functions, and providing comments to explain the purpose of each function and block of code. 
Additionally, the use of header files and separating implementation from declaration contributes to code maintainability and readability.
